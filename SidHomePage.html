<p style=”color:#000;font-size:18px;font-weight:normal;font-family:Cambria;text-align:left;”>You have managed to stumble upon my website. Welcome! </p>
<hr />
<p style=”color:#000;font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;”> I am from Bahrain, a small country in the Middle East. Having spent my entire childhood there, I know the place better than the back of my hand (which I don't think I know that well). </p>

<p style="font-size:16px"> It's a beautiful country, surrounded by water on all four sides, which means there are beaches for miles. If the pictures look too good to be true, you only have to visit to believe your eyes! </p> 

Some Interesting Facts about Bahrain -
<ul>
 <li> There is a famous Mesquite tree called “Tree of Life” which is 400 years old and stands alone in the desert of Bahrain. The fact that the water source of the tree is not known attracts huge number of visitors. </li>
 <li> Bahrain is known for its scorching summer where temperature can reach up to 45 degree Celsius and the apparent temperature along with humidity can be as high as 50 degree Celsius. </li>
 <li> In Bahrain, you can eat a camel burger. </li>
 <li> It’s the Saudi version of Vegas. The main draw is alcohol, and Saudis cross the bridge to party, spend the night in the bars and clubs, and then often attempt to drive back, causing accidents and leading some to dub the Causeway “Blood Border.” </li>
 </ul>

<strong>September 2, 2017:</strong> Started reading <em>Dracula</em> by Bram Stoker. It was rather interesting reading the origins for one of the most popular fantasy tropes. For those interested, Amazon gives it for free for all Kindles! <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Wordsworth-Classics-Bram-Stoker/dp/185326086X" target=”_blank”>Go here</a> to enjoy!</p>
