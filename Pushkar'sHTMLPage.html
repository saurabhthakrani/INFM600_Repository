    <p style="font-size:20px"><br><br>I am From Thane- the city of lakes. I did not grow up in Thane but I have spent fair share of time there. 
	The most attractive aspect of Thane is that although it is within 20 miles from Mumbai, it is still has scenic places around.
	The image is from the locality near my home. This area looks like mini Central Park. </p>
    <p style="font-size:20px">Another thing that has astonishes me about Thane is the cultural value it adds to our lives. I have always seen the best indian artists perform live.
	There are many drama theatres and auditoriams preserving our culture. As I have mentioned Thane is called the city of lakes. There are 30 lakes in my city. 'Upvan Lake' is one of the best views the fair city has to offer. 
	The annual Upvan Festival is a treat for music and art lovers and a chance to perform in front of the whole city. I have seen some breathtaking performances  </p>

	<p style="font-size:20px">Food here is absolutely to die for. I cant believe I have survived without the streetfood for more than a year. The images below are my favorite dishes. The image on the right is fried dumplings with cheese. 
	*caution: Too spicy!!! (even for me).
